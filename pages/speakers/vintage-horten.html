          <p>"THE VINTAGE HORTEN D ARE INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL speakers. Their sound has everything I expect from a "transmitter" of music, i.e. timbre, density, weight and mass... And that bass...

            "Już pierwsze takty pokazały niesamowity realizm brzmienia... Całości przekazu towarzyszył niesamowity rozmach. Dźwięk potrafił nacierać, atakować i pięknie wypełniał całe pomieszczenie. Można wręcz powiedzieć, że pomieszczenie grało wraz z muzyką.Basu było tyle ile trzeba i był dobrej jakości. Zdyscyplinowany i punktowy."
