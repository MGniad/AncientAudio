    <h2>
      Last year Ancient Audio worked out a small active monitor speakers called
      “Studio Oslo”. Originally this was supposed to be a curiosity for
      audiophiles of modest means. It was also designed as a tool for small
      recording studios. Eventually it turned out to be an ideal device for
      domestic use. Low price, small size, direct and lively sound when
      connected to a CD player , PC, TV-set or even a mobile turned out to be an
      immediate hit as there were no such products on the market.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The success of “Studio Oslo” (the best selling Ancient Audio product so
      far) stimulated the firm to design a bigger-sized construction on the
      basis of Ancient Audio project of the audio system for digital piano. 
    </p><p>
      The
      correct sound reproduction of this royal instrument requires retaining an
      ideal timbre, dynamics and resolution of the instrument. After some
      modifications had been applied a new product - “Master Oslo” was born. It
      refers in its concept to active mini monitor speakers based on a fullrange
      driver. 
    </p><p>
      A new bigger speaker is applied which considerably influenced not
      only the lower end but effectiveness as well. Bigger speaker can be driven
      by a more powerful amplifier. Additionally, a new sound processor
      increases resolution and neutrality of midrange. A pair of XLR input
      sockets indicates their professional origin. Moreover any signal source
      can be connected through two pairs of RCA sockets of different
      sensitivity. 
    </p><p>
      Lower sensitivity is enough for such hi-fi components as CD
      player or DAC. The higher one, in turn, is suitable for PC, TV set or a
      mobile which is a favourite source of music for a younger generation of
      listeners. 
    </p><p>
      Excellent resolution and neutrality of sound reproduction show
      well recorded sound during the recording session. Master Oslo is true
      nearfiled monitor - it can be auditionning form distances less than 1 m.
      However, it is tolerant for inferior sound - namely omnipresent MP3
      format. 
    </p><p>
      The application of single, fullrange driver enables a short
      listening distance. “Master Oslo” is a true nearfiled monitor, it can be
      auditioned form distance of 1 meter or shorter.

    </p><p>
      “Master Oslo” is a true nearfiled monitor, it can be
      auditioned form distance of 1 meter or shorter. Similarly to “Studio Oslo”
      the core idea behind the “Master Oslo” is its original signal processor.
      Designed in order to perfectly reproduce the sound of piano it had to meet
      highly restrictive requirements. That is the reason why the work on it
      have been carried on for over a year. The casing is firmly joined to the
      base. 
    </p><p>
      The bass – reflex port is directed downward but the flow of air is
      directed through a slit both forward and sideways. Vibrations have been
      considerably reduced when compared to a former “Studio Oslo” model. The
      base also provided for a greater stability of this speaker . A greater
      volume of reproduced sound and bass makes it possible to be used in
      greater space. 
    </p><p>
      In most cases one can dispense with a subwoofer. Needless
      to say that in need of greater levels of sound volume you can couple this
      speaker with a dedicated subwoofer – the “Sub Oslo” to increase bass
      dynamics. 
    </p><p>
      The speakers can easily be mounted by means of provided stands.
      Thanks to its small size but extraordinary quality of sound “Master Oslo”
      will surely be exceptional tool for field recordings. Those who travel a
      lot will find a professional, solid case for speaker transportation very
      useful and handy.
