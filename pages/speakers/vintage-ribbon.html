      Vintage Ribbon is floorstanding, non compromise speaker system.
    </h2>
    <p class="">
      It was designed for low power tuve amplifers, as well as high SPL
      reproducing music, in medium and big rooms.
      </p>
      <p>
        This speaker links two the
        best previous Ancient Audio speaker designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Vintage" , gave high
        efficiency concept, basing on large woofer, with very strong magnet, and
        high B x L motor.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Wing Speaker System " inspired to use ribbon midrange /
        tweeter driver. 
      </p>
      <p>

        Woofer of speaker system was made by Italian B&C , leader
        of PA drivers.<br>15 inches ( 38 cm ) huge diaphragm , however lightweight is
        classical, vinatge paper design. 
      </p>  
      <p>

        However, magnet system and voice coil are
        modern. Strong neodymium magnet enables high efficiency, 100 dB/W/m. High
        temperature voice coil can handle up to 1000 W of music power, what means
        130 dB - comparable do starting jet airplane.
      </p>
      <p>
      Big area, hard suspension ,
      high motor force made incredible impact , power, energy and control of
      bass. Even driving by anemic triode amplifiers, Vintage Ribbon easy makes
      live rock concert impression. Not only because high volume, but mostly by
      speed.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Ribbon midrange/ tweeter is unique too. Raw of neodymium magnets creates 1
      T of field. It is not impressive... unit you point that gap is 25 mm. The
      thin leaf of multilayer ribbon is both diaphragm and voicecoil. It weights
      less, than moving air, makes sound of whole speaker system extremally
      detailed, with excellent microdynamics. Due to special Ancient Audio
      technology, this driver covers audio band since 800 Hz up to 40 KHz. So,
      the most music information comes from one, small transducer.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Vintage Ribbon can be driven by 2A3, 300 B or any other low power Single
      Ended Triode amplifier. These amplifiers has excellent sound, however
      limited power. Speaker efficiency compensates it, creating amazing sound,
      also with energy and volume. 
      </p>
      <p>
        
        Because the most informations came from very
        small diaphragm, so it is possible to comfortable auditionning Vintage
        Ribbon from small distance, enjoying also huge soundstage. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Speakers are
        both energetic and smooth, what is rare combination. So, driven by
        transistor amplifer speakers can show not only muscules of music, but
        feather touch too. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We strongly recommend to play Vintage Ribbon with
        Digital Speaker Processor, what make huge improvment of sound. It will
        create any aspect of music.
