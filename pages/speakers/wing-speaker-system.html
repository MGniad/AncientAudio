      <p>Wing Speaker System</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="product"></h2>
    <p class="">
      In my experience as an audiophile and constructor it has often happened
      that a feeling of a classy sound stayed with me for a very long time. It
      involved almost unlimited dynamics of “horn“ speakers, smoothness and
      liquidity of 300B triode, transparency of a speaker ribbon, the thump of
      bass of a solid state “power plant”, the 3 dimensional sound stage of
      Italian masters speakers and coherency of vinyl. In reality, almost each
      hi-end system I have auditioned always has some unique feature, making one
      kind of music aspect sound excellent but leaving others not quite up to
      the mark. It has always been my goal to make a music system that would
      easily reflect music in an unimpeded manner by simply melting all the best
      features of different sound systems into one. After many years of
      searching and testing, thanks to the contribution of a very friendly jazz
      percussionist and businessman ( mr. John Tu, owner of Kigston Technology )
      the dream eventually came true. The Wing Speaker System came into being.
    </p>
    <h2>The scale of sound:</h2>
    <p>
      Reaching the level of 120 dB (which the conductor hears at the pulpit)
      requires the speakers of very high efficiency or very powerful amplifiers.
      Both were applied while building the system. The bass sound is reproduced
      by 1200 Watts being fed from 8 solid state amps. The remaining frequency
      band in the range between 650 Hz and 35KHz is covered by a unique ribbon
      speaker – RAVEN 3.2 MMX of very high efficiency. It was possible due to
      powerful magnets NeFeB. The weight of the ribbon speaker is 18 kg. The
      total efficiency of the Wing Speaker is 100dB/W/m
    </p>

    <h2>Dynamics:</h2>
    <p>
      Thump and speed is made by silver grand valve mono amplifiers, solid state
      amps as well as the application of appropriate speaker drivers. Eton bass
      drivers have got very stiff but light Kevlar and Nomex membrane of
      honeycomb structure. A great number of speaker cones of great total area
      are characterized by fast and linear work even at very high sound levels.
    </p>

    <h2>Background information:</h2>
    <p>
      A remarkably great number of details are provided by excellent Lektor
      Grand SE, a consecutive version of one of the world best CD players.
      Another element in the line of sound reproduction is Silver Grand Mono
      with its internal silver wiring, teflon insulation and capacitors. The
      ultra-light ribbon of Raven 3.2 MMX (only 35 mg in weight) conveys every
      minute detail without any loss.

    <h2>Sound stage:</h2>
    <p>
      Reproduction of the acoustics and focusing of musical instruments are the
      result of the perfect harmony of the system. What matters most is the
      build and architecture of the Wing Speaker thanks to its slim shape that
      eliminates diffraction and concave front panel responsible for providing a
      time coherent sound.
    </p>
    <h2>Neutrality:</h2>
    <p>
      The lack of coloration is due to applying a ribbon which, in fact, is a
      point source of sound for the majority of the acoustic band starting to
      work up 650Hz. It is noteworthy that all area that human ear is most
      sensitive to is covered by one ultra light vibrating element.
    </p>
    <h2>Sound control:</h2>
    <p>
      The speed of sound attack important as well as its fast reverberation. It
      is stimulated by the wing-like construction of the Wing Speaker making the
      most stiff and closed forms ever. The speaker cabinet skeleton is made of
      marine-grade plywood, one inch side walls are glued from sheets of
      Superform tin plywood.

    <h2>Homogeneous sound:</h2>
    <p>
      Ancient Audio belongs to a very exquisite club of complete music system
      manufacturers. The whole system consists of extraordinary sound
      reproducing units, which are ideally harmonized one another. The overall
      synergy of the CD player, amplifiers and speakers creates a harmonious
      unity which creates an illusion of true-to-life music.
      <br />In order to make the most of the drivers and amplifiers, crossovers
      are placed before amplifiers: the passive LC for mid/high band and the
      active one for low. The amps working band is optimized for a particular
      bandwidth.
      <br />
      The Wing Speaker System has been designed for an area of about 100 square
      meters. It is sold exclusively as a complete system: Speakers, amplifiers,
      CD player, cables, power cords and is mounted by the founders of Ancient
      Audio. The price includes acoustics adaptation project.
      <br />
      The success of the Wing Speaker System made it possible to design a
      smaller version, but equally uncompromising. The Wing Speaker System is
      too big (2 m in height and 200 liters volume) for average European or
      Asian living conditions. This is the reason why Ancient Audio have made a
      Little Wing Speaker with a single woofer/solid state amp and raven 3.2 MMX
      retaining all the features of the uncompromising construction. The Little
      Wing Speaker System is delivered with the same amps, CD player and cabling
      as the bigger one.
