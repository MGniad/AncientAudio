      audio products.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Amplifier “Silver Grand Mono”, CD player “Lektor Grand”, “Wing Speaker System” or Digital Speaker Processor set
      company reputation as top of top products.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, company experience was used to design affordable, well sounding , easy to use systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Passion for music, passion for good sound moved us to design small, inexpencive , high sound quality speakers.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Introducing Studio Oslo in 2012, Ancient Audio created first small, compact , desktop speaker , however generated
      mature big sound in near field. Designed for small recording studios, Studio Oslo gained big attention to pure
      home applications, as small high quality active speaker for desktop systems, computers, mobile phones, tablets, TV
      sets. It was bestseller, despite of being out of Ancient Audio expensive product line.
    </p>

    <p>
      The concept was successful, it was continued by Master Oslo, and totally new line, branded by <a
        href="www.fram-audio.com"> Fram</a>
    </p>
    <p>Vintage Oslo keeps Ancient Audio way: classic look, but the most modern technology inside.
    </p>


    <p>First model, got very positive opponions from the most experienced journalists and audiphiles. Positive response
      was lead us to make new , improved model. We thought about minor changes, but eventually, totally new speaker was
      made.
      They also uses Polish SXT driver, but with bigger voice coil. So, more powerful amplifiers were possible to apply.
    </p>
    <p>But the biggest change is in input section. New Vinthage Oslo can be equip with digital input, S/P DIF.
      They are called "speakers". However it is integrated DAC, Digital Speaker Processor, Amplifier and Speaker System
      in one box. It made signal path short, and eventually more dynamic, more transparent sound to compare with use
      analog inputs.
    </p>

    <p>However, we offer more affordable version, with analog inputs only.</p>

    <img src="../../static/img/vintage_oslo/Vintage_Oslo_II_studio.jpg" alt="vintage-oslo" />

    <p>This speaker uses Ancient Audio Digital Speaker Processor P3 MK I-E, what corrects speaker imperfections by
      unique algorithm.
    </p>
    <h2>It improves:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>dynamics</li>

      <li>natural sounding</li>

      <li>soundstage depth and width</li>

      <li>instrument separation</li>

      <li>focusing</li>

      <li> bass impact</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Leaving away classic, power hungry and hot in touch class AB amplifiers, it is applied Class D solution with cool
      running, low power consumption, however still with warm sound signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vintage Oslo were designed to play in medium size rooms, they were tuned in 27 sq.m. famous Ancient Audio room.
      Playing in moderate levels, they can fill even this area by spartial, natural sounding music.
    </p>

    <p>
      But desks, and close distance listening are real kingdom of these minis. Due to single driver, and sophisticated
      DSP
      algorithm, they can be auditioned in real nearfield , as close as 70 cm. In that conditions, Vintage Oslo creates
      excellent space reproduction and holography-like sound imaging, incredible soundstage, with dynamic, high
      resolution, rich and warm sound. High sound quality enables speakers to use in professional musical applications,
      like electronic instruments or studio recording monitoring.

      The Processor program was optimized for both kind of listening environment. Programs are selecting by back switch,
      with vivid and soft program for desktop, personal listening, as well as whole room play.
