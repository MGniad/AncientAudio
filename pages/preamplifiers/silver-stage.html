      Ancient Audio company got the fame by CD players, and vacuum tube
      amplifiers.

      However, black vinyl records are more „ancient”, than silver discs.
      Rebirth of black records pushed Ancient Audio to use own broad experience
      in amplifiers design, to make hi-end dedicated MM / MC phono preampliifer.
      The device was designed as small box, to „Set and forget” . The reason is
      simple. electric signals from MC cartridge are extremally small.
      Electronics, cables, power supply can take electric and magnetic noise. To
      reduce noice ( usually mains network hum) needs careful placement cables
      and electronics. So, phono premaplifier should be as small as possible, to
      easy place in the most comfortable place, far from power transformers of
      for example power amplifier. But, this place can be far from favourite
      equipment table. Small, low power , closed device implified to use
      transistors, instead of tubes ( Ancient Audio speciality) . Tubes are
      queens of amplification of CD basing systems. Delicate softness of tubes
      makes less irritating sharp sound of CD. However, vinyl records are more
      lazy. They needs vitality of transistors. Second reason to use transistors
      is need to low noise level. Noises of tubes are higher, because they are
      working in higher temperatures. It is very hard to make tube MC
      preamplifier without step-up input transformer – an additial source of
      distorstions. Demands of MC amplifer are very high, gain must be over 10
      000 , but with low noise, low distortions. So, Silver Stage uses five
      stages of amplifiecation, working only with local feedback. Due to very
      high gain, it was necessarry to make fully balanced circuit. Topology is
      similar to the most demanding amplifiers in electronics: vertical
      amplifiers for oscilloscopes. They must give high gain, from DC to hundred
      of MHz. And with minimal distortions, noise, temperature immunity. Fully
      balanced topology made XLR balanced outputs natural, not just by inverting
      phase of RCA inputs, as most of preamplifiers. To linear work, FET
      transistors were applied. They have lot of advantages, however one
      problem. Their parameters are vary piece from piece , by 100 , sometimes
      200 %. So, each and every of 26 transistors was needed to be carefully
      selected, in few temperatures. It makes manufacture of this preamplifier
      very complex, labour consuming. RIAA network, mutistage RC type needs also
      fine selection of components, to keep left to right chanel perfect balance
      in whole audio spectrum.

      All switches are hermetically sealed miniature relays, with very low ON
      impedance. It is important, because impedance of MC cartridges is just few
      ohms, like speakers. All internal wiring is made of pure silver, like
      other hi-end Ancient Audio products. To keep power transformer as far as
      possible, power supply is separasted. Cabinet is made from non magnetic
      componets. There are two versions: silver, stainless steel ; or golden
      /black bade of brass and aluminium
