      <p>Lektor Transport</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="product">In 1997, Ancient Audio made first Lektor CD player, inaugurating the production of high-end CDs
      in Poland. </h2>
    <p>Mature players, like Lektor Grand, Lektor Prime, Lektor Air established company in exclusive club of the best CD
      players in the world. </p>
    <p>
      All these famous players were based on Philips CD-Pro 2 mechanism. It was considered as the best made, and the
      best sounding mass availaible CD drive.
    </p>

    <h2>Stop of manufacturing own CD line by Philips, was lead company to seek alternative solutions. Fortunatelly,
      Austrian company Stream Unlimited Optical Storage developed successor , CD-Pro 8.</h2>
    <p>It bases on three beam laser picup, and similar decoder as CD-Pro2. Also, it is build in solid, stable aluminium
      chassis. However, sophisticated vibration control due to carbon fibre components, more advanced electronics and
      wide tunning ways created much better drive. </p>
    <p>CD Transport is a digital device. So, precise timing is the key of sound data transmission. Lektor uses Tent Labs
      low jitter clock. But it's role is total. Usually, a complete CD transport device has multiple clocks to contol CD
      reading, remote control , keyboard scan, display, etc. These clocks are non syncronised, makes unwanted, digital
      noise . This noise ( called jitter ) significantly limits the ability to reproduce the subtle nuances of music.
    </p>

    <h2>Lektor Transport uses only one clock, 16.9344 MHz. It is common to all processes of reading CD, driving display,
      receiving remote control commands. </h2>
    <p>Combining with ultra fast, direct coupled S/P DIF drivers, microwave approved, low looses cables, makes perfect
      transmission of all music informations, contained in record. </p>
    <p>
      This is explanation, why so many listeners, auditionning Lektor Transport, are shocking by details, never present
      before. These details were previously lost by imperfect reading and transmission.
    </p>
    <p>One piece, solid aluminium base, CNC machined, create non magnetic, resonat free, stable mechanical build. </p>
