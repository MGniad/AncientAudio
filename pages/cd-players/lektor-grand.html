      <p>Lektor Grand</p>

    <h2 class="product">
      It has been a few years now since a world premiere of the first three
      piece CD player - Lektor Grand – with two mono digital-to-analogue
      converters. The general concept of the multi-box player proved to be right
      and won a wide-world recognition.

    <p class="">
      Ever since the Lektor Grand hit the market its stately looks and
      outstanding sonics made it rank among the very exceptional few on
      irrespective of the price tag. Wherever auditioned, in London, Oslo, US
      its shear beauty of music rose the eyebrows of disbelief for such uncommon
      musical presentation. As Andrew Harrison stated in his Hi- Fi News:
      “…thanks to its sweet, liquid and organic presentation there are few
      machines that will take you closer to the heart of the music.” The passing
      time and new technological achievements have made it realize that what
      could have been best yesterday is no longer good enough today.

      Ancient Audio have eventually decided to launch an entirely new project
      but maintain, at the same time, a link with the past by retaining the
      proper name of the top of the line of Ancient Audio CD players in line
      with the concept of an open-up top loader and a three piece design. All
      the rest have been substantially refurbished. Firstly, the mechanical
      concept of the casing has been redesigned to make the CD mechanism even
      more impervious to any outside interference due to its sandwich
      construction with a layer of proprietary vibration absorbent in between
      two slabs of granite. Secondly, the CD transport is provided with three
      separate power transformers for CD drive, digital electronics and the
      front panel display respectively. Thirdly, a new proprietary Silver DAC
      III and an isolation of the master clock constitute a new attitude to
      designing transport mechanisms. On top of it all, there is a battery of
      V-cap Teflon film capacitors to bring out sound liquidity, transparency
      and inner detail in an unprecedented manner.

      What you are presented with as a final product is not only a more refined
      appearance but the PLAYER capable of linking the powerful with the
      intimate, transparency with unparalleled high resolution, depth and width
      of the musical presentation with multi–layered and three dimensional
      scene, liquidity and inner detail with a wide palette of harmonics.
