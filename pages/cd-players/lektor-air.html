      2004 Cracow manufacturer "Ancient Audio" build Lektor Grand CD player, the
      first ever player made up of three separate pieces: a unique CD transport
      and accompanying DAC mono blocks.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Highly advanced digital signal transmission technology in line with a
      thorough knowledge of tube and analogue layout designing resulted in
      extraordinary sound reproduction and has been enjoying the renown ever
      since. It was the Lektor Grand project that made it possible for Lektor
      Grand to become a leading manufacturer of digital sound reproducers. 
      </p>
      <p>
      In
      the meantime Lektor Grand went through a complete internal upgrade that
      lead up to its SE version, once again, setting an ultimate level of
      excellence and a benchmark for other ambitious projects irrespective of
      price. Following the success of Lector Grand and its breakthrough concepts
      a new integrated versions hit the market a few years after Lektor Grand
      premiere. It turned out to be most frequently bought Ancient Audio CD
      player due to its outstanding sound reproduction, analogue inputs and
      reasonable price tag.

      The Lektor Air on show, was designed to be a more
      advanced version of Lektor Prime at first, however, it developed far
      beyond the tentative project assumptions. Despite its similar looks to
      Lektor Prime it is a different construction having much more in common
      with Lektor Grand design, the most important of which is an extremely
      accurate and precise low jitter (3ps) master clock manufactured by Tent
      Labs :

    <h2>
      All Lektors, except for The Grand One, are of integrated nature with a
      valve preamplifier. The Air Lektor like other integrated constructions has
      got analog input for the line level signal sources.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A new facility applied to The Air Lektor is an expansion slot for digital
      input modules. It will make it possible in future to apply digital input
      (such as S/P DIF, AES/EBU, USB) and utilize The Lektor Air as state of the
      art outboard DAC for music servers, computers, etc. 
      </p>
      <p>

        The sound signature is
        a natural development of the Ancient Audio sound with its lively and
        natural aspects devoid of digital glare with lots of "air" and 3-D
        presentation (depth, height, width) and live music acoustics. All these
        quality of presentation account for the name of this CD model - THE AIR.
      </p>
        
<p>
      Tangibility of musical events and its focusing makes a music presentation
      a breathtaking event. All this being coupled with unprecedented dynamic
      contrasts and spectacular "imaging" of silence which from being
      underestimated aspect in music is brought forward as an equal part of any
      musical presentation.
