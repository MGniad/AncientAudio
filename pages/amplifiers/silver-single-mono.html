  <h2 class="product">
    In 2004, Ancient Audio made „Silver Grand Mono” power amplifer.
  </h2>
  <p class="">
    Applied innovative solutions , for classic 300 B concept crearted not only
    company flagship, but also one of the best audio amplifer ever made. Fast
    solid state power supply, multiple decoupling power stages, silver wired
    output transformer, dual mono / dual extrenal power supply, no feedback
    output stage set new rules of top-hi end amplifiers design. Constantly
    developed, „Silver Grand Mono” is still reference amplifer. However, even
    king has some limits. First was use of double 300 B per chanel. It was not
    only costly, but generates some troubles with purchase rare editions of
    tubes. Second, was long way of power lines; from power supply via 1 meter
    power cable , then power socket to amplifer. Eventually These
    disadvantages were lead us to design „Silver Single Mono” It still keeps
    main principles of „Silver Grand Mono”. But it has only one 300 B tube per
    chanel. This solution is prefered by some audiophiles. Single tube will be
    always more linear, than two tubes connected in paralell. Power is lower ,
    8 W per chanell, but it is sufficient for many systems, where sound
    quality is over loudness.

  <h2>The most interesting part of „Silver Single Mono” is power supply .</h2>
  <p>
    First, mains AC power is changed to very stable 24 V DC. It also makes a
    first stage of galvanic separation. This DC power supply bases on
    switching way, so power transformer is very small, with small capacitance.
    It prevents to come mains power noise between winding of transformer.
    Then, DC 24 V is feeding monoblock next switching power supply.
  </p>
  <h2>This power supply is uniuqe.</h2>
  <p>It makes all voltages, needed for 300 B amplifer:
  <ul>
    <li>420 V for HT 300 B
    </li>
    <li>130 V for gird bias 300 B</li>
    <li>5 V for heating 300 B</li>
    <li>6,3 V for heating E88CC</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Power supply has two separates transformers to minimize interference. They are driving by separate MOS switches,
    but with common frequency.



    Additionally, voltages are stabilised by high accuracy linear regulators.



    Whole unit has another unique feature: start up is very slow, it takes 60 seconds. Eventually, all voltges are
    growing very gradually. It prevents 300 B delicate cathode wire from thermal shock. Tube fatigue is much lower, and
    life of sometimes very expencive and rare tubes is significancy longer.
    As well as
    „Single Grand Mono”, new monoblocks has unique auto bias iddle current circuit. It makes amplifier totally
    mainternace free, keeping requied bias same, after change, or ageing.
    Another advantage this complex power supply is extremally low noise of amplifer. It is important, when connected to
    high efficiency speakers.</p>
