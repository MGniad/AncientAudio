    <h2>
      20 years ago Ancient Audio, a small manufacture company launched an
      amplifier “hybrid” as its first product onto the market. It was a compact
      amplifier with a distinctive natural sound reproduction that brought to
      mind the best in amplification of those bygone days.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since then the company has developed its scope of products which
      eventually culminated in the production of Grand Silver Mono amplifier
      considered by many to be the best single-ended vacuum tube amplifier ever
      produced. 
    </p><p>
      To commemorate its round anniversary Ancient Audio wants to
      recall its first product as a paragon of well-shaped retro size,
      simplicity of circuit typology and above all – a signature sound. All
      these characteristics are shared by a new amplifier which makes use of the
      whole experimental and developmental background accumulated during the
      whole period. 
    </p><p>
      The best amplifiers are of Class A Single Ended
      architecture. The reason for that is quite understandable – the same array
      of amplifying elements work for both positive and negative audio signals.
      It is of paramount importance to transfer steadily minute sound signals
      especially when their positive or negative parts do the zero – crossing.
      This is the weakest point of push-pull amplifiers. Although they are
      powerful and relatively of high efficiency their performance at lower
      volumes leave much to be desired. 
    </p><p>
      Let’s take an example of a real sound
      signal – a jazz trio:
    </p>

    <p>
      As one can see the majority of sound signal is of rather low character. It
      is there where the beauty of music lies with all its nuances and emotional
      impact. That is why Single Ended constructions seem the only option in
      cost no object solutions although they also have some limitations at
      highest levels of sound volume. This in turn is an area where push–pull
      boasts an undisputed advantage providing high voltage and amperage.
    </p>
    <img src="../../static/img/a-3/u1334.png" alt="a-3" />
    <p>
      That is why A-3 seems the best combination of these two worlds: the
      single-ended world and the push-pull one. At low levels it works as a
      single-ended and at high levels as a push-pull configuration rendering
      timbre and details at its most faithful and natural way while at higher
      volumes provides power and punch so typical of push-pull constructions.
      </p>
      <p>A-3 is a fulfilment of dreams about an ideal amplifier: powerful and
      trouble free as transistor, but sounding fine as the best Single Ended
      Triode tube gear.
