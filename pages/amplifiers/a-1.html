      The Success of P-3 (Ancient Audio flagship product) and P-1 lived up to
      its expectations. It has shown beyond any doubt that the idea of
      correcting some imperfections of a loudspeaker by means of highly
      specialized custom-made processor brings about excellent results enhancing
      the performance of each and every hi-fi system.
    </h2>
    <p class="">
      But P-3 and P-1 were just outboard processors . They need to be placed
      before amplifier. It gave the idea , to make one device, integrating both
      Digital Speakerr Processor and amplifier. A-1 processor makes use of the
      same algorithm and central flagship P-3 unit of the processor as well. It
      has a smaller storage capacity for different preset modes of the speakers
      (125 instead of 250). A-1 amplifier works in Class D, what makes it small,
      efficient, and easy to drive any small or medium size speaker. Little size
      make it ideal to personal or life style systems. But small size doesnâ€™t
      mean the small sound...Delivering over 120 W , it can make really dynamic
      sound, with huge soundstage, and punchy bass impact.

    <p>The P-3 MK I E processor influences:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The sound dynamics</li>
      <li>The musical separation of instruments</li>
      <li>Musical instruments positioning on a stage</li>
      <li>Space & recording venue acoustics</li>
      <li>Bass control</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The micro-detail reproduction Loudspeaker differ widely in many respects.
      Hence the correction parameters for different models must be different.
      P-3 processor can memorize up to as many as 150 loudspeakers or headphones
      models. The present database comprises the pre-set modes for the following
      models: Dynaudio, Sonus Faber, Avantgarde, Wilson Audio, Spendor, Raidho.
      Since there is a wide variety of different makes of loudspeakers or
      headphones we can fully adapt our D-3 processor to your system to make the
      most and the best of it. The amplifier can be connect by traditional, line
      level analog signals. But also, it includes wireless Bluetooth connection.
      Matched with just phone, tablet or computer, it creates a really
      versatile, easy to operate audio system.
