      <h2 class="product">Single Solid is the compact, hi-end amplifier, Digital Speaker Processor and DAC in one box.</h2>
      <p class="">The core power amplifier is solid state, however operating in Single Ended Class-A at low level signals.

        It's build and sonic features are similar to Ancient Audio A-3 :"If you are able to stop calculate for a moment, A-3 will prove to be an amplifier capable of delivering a sensual, rich presentation with almost any loudspeakers. Its sound offers everything we value tube devices for, so wonderful 'golden' treble, powerful, rich midrange and a full, rich bass. You will find in its performance a unique depth of sound and soundstage." by <a href="https://highfidelity.pl/@main-672&lang=en">highfidelity.pl</a>  </p>

      <h2>Despite of moderate output power, amplifier can drive almost every speaker, no matter if it is low efficiency monitor or big floorstanding speaker, required perfect bass control.</h2>
      <p>Power amplifier has dual mono toplogy, feeding by 100 000 uF set of fast capacitors, and common dual winding toroidal power supply. Despite of moderate

        A-3 was great amplifier, it was driven the best sounding system at <a href="https://audiolifestyle.pl/nowosci/audio-show-2015-zlota-siodemka/">Audio Video Show '2015</a>  
        <br>
        It was designed as matching complete to famous P-3 Digital Speaker Processor / Preamplifier.
        <br>
        Excellent sound of P-3 / A-3 combo was lead to design integrated version, housed in beautiful, CNC-machined aluminium block cabinet.
        <br>
        Amplifier has four line-analog inputs, as well as two digital S/P DIF inputs, opearting with PCM, 16-24 bit, 44,1 to 212 kHz signal.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://ancient.com.pl/technology.html">Digital Speaker Processor</a> can eliminate the most of speaker's imperfections</h2>
      <p>To more convinient operation, Processor can include up to 128 different settings for many speakers. Also, in future, processor can be removable, to easy upgrade correction of speakers data.
        <br>
        Due to low noise, mainternace-free solid state electronics, Single Solid are also perfect amplifier for high efficiency, horn loaded speakers.
        <br>
        Single Solid , as compact, hi-end , easy to operate device will be main Ancient Audio amplifiers for next decade.</p>
