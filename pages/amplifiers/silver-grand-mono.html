      It is ten years now since Ancient Audio marketed its first “Hybrid”
      amplifier.
    </h2>
    <p class="">
      To commemorate our tenth anniversary we have just created “Silver Grand
      Mono”, which thanks to its breakthrough solutions at audio amplifier
      designing, sets, we firmly believe, a standard for other valve amplifiers.
      The revival of valve amplifiers dates back to Japan of the 70’s. It was
      where many ideas of valve amplifier designing were conceived. Some of them
      have withstood the test of time and become standard solutions ever since,
      while others have been abandoned along the arduous and ever winding road
      to perfection. The seventies saw the revival of vacuum tube amplifier in
      Japan. Since then some ground breaking applications have been introduced.
      Among others, these were Single Ended Triode, vacuum tube HT rectifier, AC
      heating, oil capacitors and silver transformers. Nevertheless, what seems
      to have been an excellent practice yesterday is no longer good enough for
      us at the beginning of the third millennium. What we started to work on at
      Ancient Audio was to remodel our thinking about sound amplification and
      produce a “go-between” component which would in no way influence and
      impede the sound on its way from the source unit and speakers up to the
      listener’s ears. It is not only the question of natural sound reproduction
      but the ability to convey intangible, but no less important, emotional
      information inherent in each type of music which discriminates the music
      system from a typical one. It is no longer “being there”, which some
      high-end audio manufacturers have managed to achieve, that really matters.
      “Being a must” is still not enough. You must participate, be taken
      entirely away by its sheer beauty, emotional capacity and overall impact.
      And this is what we have, after ten years of extreme dedication and
      never-ending auditions, have eventually achieved. Not just one more “the
      best amplifier” on the market. It is by far more than this. If we stopped
      at that, it would only mean still another technically perfect product. We
      have spent too much time, and put our souls into it to be satisfied by
      that. We have managed to capture the essence of music which is a
      conglomerate of notes and artist’s individualism, along with a sense of
      place of the music performed.

      What we present as our ultimate achievement can be roughly, even though
      not comprehensively enough summarized in a few sentences:
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Neither local nor global feedback, which could result in pulse shape
        degradation and harmonic distortion. Although the global feedback
        absence has become a routine solution, it is the absence of the local
        one that elevates, among other things, the sonic performance to
        exceptional levels. Needless to say, present day valve amplifier’s
        emitter or cathode follower sports 100% local feedback.
      </li>
      <li>
        Handpicked and best components available. It is worth mentioning 300B
        mesh plate tubes, Teflon capacitors, purest silver ribbon wiring for all
        inside electrical paths and specially designed, hand-made Teflon
        insulated speaker transformer with output silver wiring.
      </li>
      <li>
        A revolutionary MPS (mono power supply) – two piece outboard unit which
        eliminates any pernicious inter circuit and crossover influences. Each
        power supply unit has extremely low impedance, both as DC and audio band
        AC. A great bank of HT smoothing capacitors stores 1000 Joule of energy.

      We proudly present our “Silver Grand Mono Amplifier, with dedicated
      outboard Mono Power Supply, which does not sonically resemble any of the
      hitherto known high-end single-ended triode amplifiers. Its sheer impact,
      dynamic response and speed, the sense of space and the bottom end, as well
      as sharply focused images and multi-layered background convey a sense of
      presence to an unimaginable degree. But what makes it the unrivalled
      amplifier is the way a listener is transferred into another dimension and
      seated face to face with the performance which keeps posing a question:
      “Is it really possible? Never ever listened to anything like that! Wow!!”
      Don’t believe? Just sit back and listen! This is Ancient Audio. This is
      the way the music sounds!

        " The Silver showed something more – classy hi-end devices differentiate
        – just to visualize it better – on a scale from 0 to 10. The Silver goes
        up to 15. It may seem not being a big difference, but this is only a
        mirage...The sound depth is incredible – due to the extraordinary high
        resolution the virtual sources are drawn in a truly three-dimensional
        way and placed in a very big, natural space of the stage. The depth in
        the limits of a given sound event is so big, that I cannot compare it
        with anything.."
