      The Success of P-3 (Ancient Audio flagship product) lived up to its
      expectations. It has shown beyond any doubt that the idea of correcting
      some imperfections of a loudspeaker by means of highly specialized
      custom-made processor brings about excellent results enhancing the
      performance of each and every hi-fi system.

    <p class="">
      P-1 makes use of the same algorithm and central unit of the processor as
      well. It has a smaller storage capacity for different preset modes of the
      speakers (125 instead of 250) Additional useful feature of P-1 is that it
      can be utilised to work with earphones. A whole range of preset modes have
      been successfully worked out for such headphones as: AKG, Grado, Fostex,
      HyperX.<br> P-1 can be adapted to work with dynamic earphones and a built-in
      headphone amplifier can easily drive any dynamic transducers within 16
      -600 ohm range.

    <h2>The P-1 processor influences:</h2>
    <p><ul> 
        <li> The sound dynamics</li>
    <li>The musical separation of instruments</li>
        
        
<li> Musical instruments positioning on a stage
</li>    
        
        
<li>   Space & recording venue acoustics
</li>       
<li>    Bass control
</li>       
        
        
<li>    The micro-detail reproduction
</li>       
    </ul> 
        
        Loudspeaker differ widely in many respects. Hence the correction parameters for different models must be different. P-3 processor can memorize up to as many as 150 loudspeakers or headphones models. The present database comprises the pre-set modes for the following models: Dynaudio, Sonus Faber, Avantgarde, Wilson Audio, Spendor, Raidho.
        
        
        
        Since there is a wide variety of different makes of loudspeakers or headphones we can fully adapt our D-3 processor to your system to make the most and the best of it.</p>
