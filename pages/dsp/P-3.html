      A loudspeaker is the most imperfect element that makes up a hi-fi system.
      A complex mechanical effects may result in sound distortions. That is why
      since 1930’s a considerable effort has been undertaken to correct
      imperfections of loudspeakers by means of DSP processor. The idea behind
      is a very good one as opposed to its applications which do not help much
      to improve the overall sound. The reason is a very simple one. The DSP
      application do not help to solve the problem of bad music reproduction at
      its source but only the symptoms of it.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ancient Audio with its 20 years’ experience in music systems construction
      solved this problem in their own unique way.
    </p>
    <p>
      They began with their own
      physical and mathematical model of a loudspeaker which describes a given
      loudspeaker’s imperfections and provides, by means of calculating
      algorithms, an appropriate and unique corrective signal for each
      loudspeaker individually.
    </p>
    <p>In order to achieve it in real time it was
      necessary to create propriety Digital Speaker Processor chip. Since his
      chip works in digital domain it can be used directly in a digital track
      like it is in a CD player between the CD transport and D/A converter.

    <h2>Here are more information regarding this technology</h2>
    <p>
      From the point of view of an end user, the best solution is to have a
      separate device coupled with an analogue section, as we do with a classic
      pre-amplifier. That is P-3: Digital Signal Processor and an Pre-Amplifier
      in one. It accepts both RCA and XLR connectors. The processor changes
      analogue signals through the A/D converter into digital ones and corrects
      them by means of DSP. Digitally corrected data are then changed back into
      analogue ones through A/D converter and a sophisticated output stage. All
      these parts are modeled after these of famous Lektor Grand & Lektor Air.
      The output section has an identical build but makes use of FET transistors
      which in consequence provides an unchangeable sound throughout its
      operation.</p>
    <p>
      P-3 can considerably improve the sound of each and single
      hi-end system.</p>

    <p>The P-3 DSP processor influences:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> The sound dynamics
      </li>
      <li>The
        musical separation of instruments
      </li>
      <li>Musical instruments positioning on a
        stage
      </li>
      <li>Space & recording venue acoustics
      </li>
      <li>Bass control
      </li>
      <li>The micro-detail
        reproduction</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Loudspeaker differ widely in many respects. Hence the
      correction parameters for different models must be different. P-3
      processor can memorize up to as many as 250 loudspeakers models. The
      present database comprises the pre-set modes for the following models:
      Dynaudio, Sonus Faber, Avantgarde, Wilson Audio, Spendor, Raidho.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since
      there is a wide variety of different makes of loudspeakers, we can fully
      adapt our D-3 processor to your system to make the most and the best of
      it. The whole procedure of adaptation to a particular system lasts for
      about a few hours and can be carried out in any place in European
      Community.
