      A loudspeaker is the most imperfect element that makes up a hi-fi system.
      A complex mechanical effects may result in sound distortions. That is why
      since 1930’s a considerable effort has been undertaken to correct
      imperfections of loudspeakers by means of DSP processor. The idea behind
      is a very good one as opposed to its applications which do not help much
      to improve the overall sound. The reason is a very simple one. The DSP
      application do not help to solve the problem of bad music reproduction at
      its source but only the symptoms of it.

    <p class="">
      Ancient Audio with its 20 years’ experience in music systems construction
      solved this problem in their own unique way. They began with their own
      physical and mathematical model of a loudspeaker which describes a given
      loudspeaker’s imperfections and provides, by means of calculating
      algorithms, an appropriate and unique corrective signal for each
      loudspeaker individually. In order to achieve it in real time it was
      necessary to create propriety Digital Speaker Processor chip. Since his
      chip works in digital domain it can be used directly in a digital track
      like it is in a CD player between the CD transport and D/A converter.

      From the point of view of an end user, the best solution is to have a
      separate device coupled with an analogue section, as we do with a classic
      pre-amplifier. That is P-3: Digital Signal Processor and an Pre-Amplifier
      in one. It accepts both RCA and XLR connectors. The processor changes
      analogue signals through the A/D converter into digital ones and corrects
      them by means of DSP. Digitally corrected data are then changed back into
      analogue ones through A/D converter and a sophisticated output stage. All
      these parts are modeled after these of famous Lektor Grand & Lektor Air.
      The output section has an identical build but makes use of FET transistors
      which in consequence provides an unchangeable sound throughout its
      operation. P-3 can considerably improve the sound of each and single
      hi-end system. The P-3 DSP processor influences: - The sound dynamics -The
      musical separation of instruments - Musical instruments positioning on a
      stage -Space & recording venue acoustics - Bass control - The micro-detail
      reproduction Loudspeaker differ widely in many respects. Hence the
      correction parameters for different models must be different. P-3
      processor can memorize up to as many as 250 loudspeakers models. The
      present database comprises the pre-set modes for the following models:
      Dynaudio, Sonus Faber, Avantgarde, Wilson Audio, Spendor, Raidho. Since
      there is a wide variety of different makes of loudspeakers, we can fully
      adapt our D-3 processor to your system to make the most and the best of
      it. The whole procedure of adaptation to a particular system lasts for
      about a few hours and can be carried out in any place in European
      Community. Please feel free to contact us in order to book a visit at your
      convenience
