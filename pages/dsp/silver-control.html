    <h2>
      Ancient Audio power amplifiers, particullary Silver Grand Mono and Silver
      Single Mono are excellent sounding devices.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was leading idea of designing of matched preamplifier. However, rapid
      developing digital audio, and invent Digital Speaker Processor paused us
      to more broad solution. 
    </p><p>
      Finally, Silver Control is
      DAC/Processor/Preamplifier in one box. It accept PCM S/P DIF audio data ,
      16-24 bit, 36 to 211 kHz sampling rate. So, it can be driven by CD
      transport, audio streamer, computer or any other popular digital audio
      source. 
    </p><p>
      For USB , we recommend USB to S/P DIF bridges, like M2Tech or
      other manufacturers Device includes famous Ancient Audio Processor, what
      controls speaker imperfections. It can include up to 127 different
      programs for many speaker system. It dramatically improves quality of
      speaker sound. 
    </p><p>
      Silver Control can be driven by four analog sources, with
      line level . It can play as traditional preampliifer, or Processor as
      well, via low noise Analog to Digital Converters The DAC, and preamplifier
      section is well known, applied in famous Lektor Grand CD player. Wired by
      pure silver, it has fully balanced topology, and vacuum tube output stage.
    </p><p>
      Two high current, low impedance triodes 6H30 are used, separated by
      regarded V-Cap capacitors, Copper Teflon at input, and Oil impregnated at
      output. The volume control is pure analog, by switching of resistors set.
    </p><p>
      Low noise linear power supply , both for analog and digital part , was
      developed previously for Lektor Grand CD player. Silver Control can be
      versatile center of any vinyl, CD, streamer based hi-end system. Smooth
      but dynamic sound can drive every power amplifier
